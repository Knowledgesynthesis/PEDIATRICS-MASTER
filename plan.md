## 6. Pediatric Reasoning Framework

Teach universal logic:

1. Identify age and developmental stage  
2. Check vaccines due/overdue  
3. Identify benign vs dangerous infections  
4. Prioritize supportive care  
5. Apply weight-based dosing  
6. Assess and classify dehydration  
7. Recognize red flags requiring ED or inpatient care  
8. Consider congenital or structural causes when patterns persist  

Pitfalls:
- Overusing antibiotics for viral infections  
- Misdiagnosing bronchiolitis as asthma in infants  
- Misapplying adult dosing  
- Missing signs of severe dehydration  
- Inconsistent vaccine scheduling  
- Overworking children with simple febrile seizures
